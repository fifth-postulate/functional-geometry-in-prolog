# Functional Geometry in Prolog
This repository contains an exploration of the ideas found in the paper ["Functional Geometry"][henderson] by Peter Henderson, transposed to Prolog.

## Functional Geometry
I learned about the paper and it's contents in a workshop by [Einar HÃ¸st][host] called: [Escher in Elm][escher-in-elm].

It is a wonderfull workshop that clearly explains the ideas of Functional Geometry. I.e.

> that one could write an algebraic description, embed it in a functional program, and execute it directly
