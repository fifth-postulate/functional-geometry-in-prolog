# Functional Geometry in Prolog
This project contains an exploration of the ideas found in the paper ["Functional Geometry"][henderson] by Peter Henderson, transposed to Prolog.

## Functional Geometry
I learned about the paper and it's contents in a workshop by [Einar Høst][host] called: [Escher in Elm][escher-in-elm].

It is a wonderfull workshop that clearly explains the ideas of functional geometry. I.e.

> that one could write an algebraic description, embed it in a functional program, and execute it directly

## Prolog
These ideas can be expressed in various other languages as Einar Høst and others have shown. Examples include [F#][f#], [PostScript][postscript] and [Rust][rust].

This repository explores the ideas in [Prolog][swi-prolog].

Prolog seems well-suited to express the ideas of functional geometry.
